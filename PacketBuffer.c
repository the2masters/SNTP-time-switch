/// PacketBuffer: Combined queue for variable length packets flowing into two directions.
/// =====================================================================================
/// - A single ring buffer is used to store input and output packets.
/// - Packets are always stored continuous in memory, to allow zero copy processing of packets.
/// - Input packets can be read from the queue independent of output packets in queue.
/// - Input packets are prioritized over output packets, to allow modifying input packets in place
///   and reuse them as output packet. This has a side effect, input packets in the queue block
///   reading of output packets located in the ring buffer after the input packets.
/// - There can be multiple concurrent writer and reader.
/// - It is possible to resize a packet in the queue.
/// - Output packets need to be released after being send successfully.
/// - The length of a packet is stored in the first word of a packet in the queue, the packet data
///   follows. New packets are aligned to 4 bytes on machines where uint32 needs to be aligned to
///   4 bytes. Packet data then starts with offset of 2 bytes. This layout is beneficial for
///   storing Ethernet packets, as an Ethernet header is 14, 18 or 22 bytes long and following
///   headers contain uint32 values.
/// - The length field is also used to store a number of flags and called `state`. You have to use
///   `Packet_getLen(packet->state)` to get the length of a packet.

/// Ring buffer layout:
/// - As the packets should be stored continuous in memory, we leave unused space in the end of
///   the underlying buffer if there is not enough space to store the next packet. The beginning
///   of the unused space is marked with an empty packet with the flag `StartOver`. The next packet
///   will be stored in the beginning of the underlying buffer (if there is enough space).
/// - To optimize reading packets we even set the `StartOver` flag if there is no unused space (in
///   case the last written packet was exactly as large as the unused space). To be able to set
///   this flag we reserve an empty packet after the end of the underlaying buffer.
/// - If a new packet is written, the next packet after this new packet is marked as `EndOfRing`.
///   Until the new packet is finished, its state is `EndOfRing` | lenght. There can be multiple
///   concurrent unfinished packets, the `EndOfRing` flag is cleared, if the packet is finished.
/// - `Buffer_New()` checks for enough empty space in the RingBuffer. There is always at least
///   one empty packet between the last reader and the fastest writer. This empty packet is marked
///   as `EndOfRing`, see above.
/// - There is a flag for input and output packets. Input reader skips packet with flag `Output`,
///   but output reader blocks reading packets with flag `Input`. Packets marked as `Skip` are
///   skipped by both readers. Both readers are blocked if they reach a packet marked `EndOfRing`.
/// - After an input packet is processed, it needs to be released or resend in the output queue.
///   This changes the packet flags to `Skip` or `Output` and unblocks the output reader.

/// the state field of a packet includes 2 flag bits (MSB). This is designed to optimize
/// conditional testing of the flags.
